# Geogrid

### Update Notes:

```diff
+ Note from now on, the two testGeogrid scripts (testGeogridOptical.py and testGeogrid_ISCE.py) are only 
+  hosted on the sister module autoRIFT's GitHub page (https://github.com/leiyangleon/autoRIFT). 
+  Thus, they have been removed from this website.
```

**A Python module for precise mapping between (pixel index, pixel displacement) in imaging coordinates and (geolocation, motion velocity) in geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinates**

**Geogrid can be installed as a standalone Python module (only supports Cartesian coordinates) either manually or as a conda install (https://github.com/conda-forge/autorift-feedstock). To allow support for both Cartesian and radar coordinates, Geogrid must be installed with the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE: https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2)**

**Geogrid can be used for dense feature tracking between two images over a grid defined in an arbitrary geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate projection when used in combination with the sister autoRIFT Python module (https://github.com/leiyangleon/autoRIFT). Example applications include searching radar-coordinate imagery on a polar stereographic grid and searching Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) imagery at a specified geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate grid**
