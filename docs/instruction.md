## 6. Instructions


**Note:**

* For radar-coordinate imagery, it is recommended to run ISCE up to the step where co-registered SLC's are done, e.g. "mergebursts" for using topsApp.
* For map-projected geographic Cartesian-coordinate (e.g. optical) imagery, the images have to be co-registered with the same posting as well as the same x- and y-limits in map coordinates.
* The input DEM grid along with the auxilliary files have to be in the same map-projected geographic Cartesian coordinate projection (with x/y coordinates being easting/northing defined as distances in units of m); the geographic coordinate system (with latitude and longitude) is not supported. Users are recommended to do the GDAL coordinate transformation themselves before using Geogrid module.

**For modular use:**

* In Python environment, type the following to import the "Geogrid" module and initialize the "Geogrid" object

  _With ISCE:_

       import isce
       from contrib.geo_autoRIFT.geogrid import Geogrid, GeogridOptical
       obj = Geogrid() or obj = GeogridOptical()
       obj.configure()

  _Standalone:_

       from geogrid import GeogridOptical
       obj = GeogridOptical()

  where "Geogrid()" is for radar-coordinate imagery and "GeogridOptical()" for Cartesian-coordinate imagery.


* The "Geogrid" object has several parameters that have to be set up (listed below; can also be obtained by referring to "testGeogrid_ISCE.py"): 
  
  [Note these parameters are automatically assigned in "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" based on the dataset used, and one can also modify them for their own purpose; also notice the image pair data are not listed below, in contrast, only the imagery parameters are shown below and actually used by Geogrid, which again are automatically set up in "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" by analyzing the image pair data]
