## 6. Instructions


**Note:**

* For radar-coordinate imagery, it is recommended to run ISCE up to the step where co-registered SLC's are done, e.g. "mergebursts" for using topsApp.
* For Cartesian-coordinate imagery, the images have to be co-registered with the same posting as well as the same x- and y-limits in map coordinates.
* The input DEM grid along with the auxilliary files have to be in the geographic Cartesian coordinate projection (with geographic x, y coordinates being easting, northing defined as distances in units of m); the geographic coordinate system (with latitude and longitude) is not supported. Users are recommended to do the GDAL coordinate transformation themselves before using the current version of the Geogrid module.



**For quick use:**

_Radar-coordinate Imagery:_
* Refer to the file "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" (with ISCE) for the usage of the module and modify it for your own purpose
* Input files include the master image folder (required), slave image folder (required), a DEM (required; in units of m), local surface slope maps (unitless), velocity maps (in units of m/yr), velocity search range maps (in units of m/yr), chip size minimum/maximum maps (in units of m), stable surface mask.
* Output files include 1) the range and azimuth pixel indices (in units of integer image pixels), 2) the range and azimuth pixel displacement (in units of integer image pixels), 3) the range and azimuth search range (in units of integer image pixels), 4) the range and azimuth chip size minimum (in units of integer image pixels), 5) the range and azimuth chip size maximum (in units of integer image pixels), 6) the stable surface mask (boolean), 7) the conversion coefficients from radar range and azimuth displacement to motion velocity in geographic x-coordinate, and 8) the conversion coefficients from radar range and azimuth displacement to motion velocity in geographic y-coordinate. 

_Cartesian-coordinate Imagery:_
* Refer to the file "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" (with ISCE) and "testGeogridOptical.py" (standalone) for the usage of the module and modify it for your own purpose
* Input files include the image 1 (required), image 2 (required), a DEM (required; in units of m), local surface slope maps (unitless), velocity maps (in units of m/yr)
* Output files include 1) the horizontal and vertical pixel indices (in units of integer image pixels), 2) the horizontal and vertical pixel displacement (in units of integer image pixels), 3) the horizontal and vertical search range (in units of integer image pixels), 4) the horizontal and vertical chip size minimum (in units of integer image pixels), 5) the horizontal and vertical chip size maximum (in units of integer image pixels), 6) the stable surface mask (boolean), 3) the conversion coefficients from horizontal and vertical displacement to motion velocity in geographic x-coordinate, and 4) the conversion coefficients from horizontal and vertical displacement to motion velocity in geographic y-coordinate. 

_Note: among these, 1) will always be created, while 2) and 7-8) will be generated contingent upon that local surface slope and velocity maps are provided. The rest, i.e. 3-6) will be created only when the corresponding inputs are provided._

**For modular use:**

* In Python environment, type the following to import the "Geogrid" module and initialize the "Geogrid" object

_With ISCE:_

       import isce
       from contrib.geo_autoRIFT.geogrid import Geogrid, GeogridOptical
       obj = Geogrid() or obj = GeogridOptical()
       obj.configure()

_Standalone:_

       from geogrid import GeogridOptical
       obj = GeogridOptical()

where "Geogrid()" is for radar-coordinate imagery and "GeogridOptical()" for Cartesian-coordinate imagery.


* The "Geogrid" object has several parameters that have to be set up (listed below; can also be obtained by referring to "testGeogrid_ISCE.py"):

       Note: all the above outputs will be created. However, when "dhdxname" and "dhdyname" are not provided, "winoffname", "winro2vxname" and "winro2vyname" will be nodata everywhere; when "vxname", and "vyname" are not provided, "winoffname" will be nodata everywhere; only when all of "dhdxname", "dhdyname", "vxname", and "vyname" are provided, these four outputs ("winlocname", "winoffname", "winro2vxname" and "winro2vyname") have meaningful values. In addition, "winsrname" is meaningful when "srname" is provided; "wincsminname" is meaningul when "csminxname" and "csminyname" are provided; "wincsmaxname" is meaningul when "csmaxxname" and "csmaxyname" are provided; "winssmname" is meaningful when "ssmname" is provided. Otherwise, there will be nodata values as assigned by "nodata_out" everywhere in the outputs.

* After the above parameters are set, run the module as below to create the output files

       obj.geogrid() or obj.runGeogrid()

where "obj.geogrid()" is for radar-coordinate imagery, and "obj.runGeogrid()" for Cartesian-coordinate imagery.
