```


**A Python module of a fast and intelligent algorithm for finding the pixel displacement between two images**

**autoRIFT can be installed as a standalone Python module (only supports Cartesian coordinates) either manually or as a conda install (https://github.com/conda-forge/autorift-feedstock). To allow support for both Cartesian and radar coordinates, autoRIFT must be installed with the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE: https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2)**

**Use cases include all dense feature tracking applications, including the measurement of surface displacements occurring between two repeat satellite images as a result of glacier flow, large earthquake displacements, and land slides**  

**autoRIFT can be used for dense feature tracking between two images over a grid defined in an arbitrary geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate projection when used in combination with the sister Geogrid Python module (https://github.com/leiyangleon/Geogrid). Example applications include searching radar-coordinate imagery on a polar stereographic grid and searching Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) imagery at a specified geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate grid**

## 1. Authors

Alex Gardner (JPL/Caltech; alex.s.gardner@jpl.nasa.gov) first described the algorithm "auto-RIFT" in (Gardner et al., 2018) and developed the first version in MATLAB;

Yang Lei (GPS/Caltech; ylei@caltech.edu) translated it to Python, further optimized and incoporated to the ISCE software;

Piyush Agram (JPL/Caltech; piyush.agram@jpl.nasa.gov) set up the installation as a standalone module and further cleaned the code.

## 3. Features

* fast algorithm that finds displacement between the two images (where source and template image patches are extracted and correlated) using sparse search and iteratively progressive chip (template) sizes
* for intelligent use, user can specify unstructured spatially-varying search centers (center of the source image patch), search offsets (center displacement of the template image patch compared to the source image patch), chip sizes (size of template image patch), search ranges (size of the source image patch)
* faster than the conventional dense feature tracking "ampcor"/"denseampcor" algorithm included in ISCE by nearly 2 orders of magnitude
* supports various preprocessing modes for specified image pair, e.g. either the raw image (both texture and topography) or the texture only (high-frequency components without the topography) can be used with various choices of the high-pass filter options 
* supports image data format of unsigned integer 8 (uint8; faster) and single-precision float (float32)
* user can adjust all of the relevant parameters, as detailed below in the instructions
* a Normalized Displacement Coherence (NDC) filter is developed (Gardner et al., 2018) to filter the chip displacemnt results based on displacement difference thresholds that are scaled to the local search range
* a sparse integer displacement search is used to narrow the template search range and to eliminate areas of "low coherence" for fine decimal displacement search and following chip size iterations
* novel nested grid design allows chip size progressively increase iteratively where a smaller chip size failed
* a light interpolation is done to fill the missing (unreliable) chip displacement results using median filtering and bicubic-mode interpolation (that can remove pixel discrepancy when using other modes) and an interpolation mask is returned
* the core displacement estimator (normalized cross correlation) and image pre-processing call OpenCV's Python and/or C++ functions for efficiency 
* sub-pixel displacement estimation using a fast Gaussian pyramid upsampling algorithm that is robust to sub-pixel locking; the intelligent (chip size-dependent) selection of oversampling ratio is also supported for a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy
* the current version can be installed with the ISCE software (that supports both Cartesian and radar coordinates) or as a standalone Python module (Cartesian coordinates only)
* when used in combination with the Geogrid Python module (https://github.com/leiyangleon/Geogrid), autoRIFT can be used for feature tracking between image pair over a grid defined in an arbitrary geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate projection
* when the grid is provided in geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinates, outputs are returned in geocoded GeoTIFF image file format with the same EPSG projection code as input search grid
* **[NEW]** For feature tracking of optical images, the program now supports fetching optical images (Landsat-8 GeoTIFF and Sentinel-2 COG formats are included) as well as other inputs (e.g. DEM, slope, etc; all in GeoTIFF format) from either local machine or remotely using [GDAL virtual file systems](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html) (e.g., `/vsicurl/https://...`). For feature tracking of radar images, the program now supports fetching auxiliary inputs (e.g. DEM, slope, etc; all in GeoTIFF format) from either local machine or remotely. See the changes on the Geogrid [commands](https://github.com/leiyangleon/Geogrid).
* **[NEW]** parallel computing has been added for Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC). When using the autoRIFT commands below, users need to append a multiprocessing flag: "-mpflag $num" with "$num" being the number of threads used; if not specified, the single-core version is used. 

## 4. Possible Future Development

* for radar (SAR) images, it is yet to include the complex correlation of the two images, i.e. the current version only uses the amplitude correlation
* the GPU implementation would be useful to extend

## 6. Install

**With ISCE:**

* First install ISCE (https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2)
* Put the "geo_autoRIFT" folder and the "Sconscript" file under the "contrib" folder that is one level down ISCE's source directory (denoted as "isce-version"; where you started installing ISCE), i.e. "isce-version/contrib/" (see the snapshot below)

<img src="figures/install_ISCE.png" width="35%">

* Run "scons install" again from ISCE's source directory "isce-version" using command line

## 7. Instructions

**Note:**

* When the grid is provided in geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinates (geographic coordinates lat/lon is not supported), it is required to run the "Geogrid" module (https://github.com/leiyangleon/Geogrid) first before running "autoRIFT". In other words, the outputs from "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" or "testGeogridOptical.py" (a.k.a "winlocname", "winoffname", "winsrname", "wincsminname", "wincsmaxname", "winro2vxname", "winro2vyname") will serve as optional inputs for running "autoRIFT" at a geographic grid, which is required to generate the final motion velocity maps.
* When the outputs from running the "Geogrid" module are not provided, a regular grid in the imaging coordinates will be automatically assigned

**For quick use:**

* Refer to the file "testautoRIFT.py" (standalone) and "testautoRIFT_ISCE.py" (with ISCE) for the usage of the module and modify it for your own purpose
* Input files include the reference image (required), test image (required), and the outputs from running "testGeogrid_ISCE.py" or "testGeogridOptical.py" (optional; a.k.a "winlocname", "winoffname", "winsrname", "wincsminname", "wincsmaxname", "winro2vxname", "winro2vyname"). When "winlocname" (grid location) is specified, each of the rest optional input ("win * name") can be either used or omitted.
* Output files include 1) estimated horizontal displacement (equivalent to range for radar), 2) estimated vertical displacement (equivalent to minus azimuth for radar), 3) light interpolation mask, 4) iteratively progressive chip size used. 

_Note: These four output files will be stored in a file named "offset.mat" that can be viewed in Python and MATLAB. When the grid is provided in geographic Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinates, a 4-band GeoTIFF with the same EPSG code as input grid will be created as well and named "offset.tif"; a 2-band GeoTIFF of the final converted motion velocity in geographic x- (easting) and y- (northing) coordinates will be created and named "velocity.tif". Also, it is possible to save the outputs in netCDF standard format by adding the "-nc" option to the "testautoRIFT.py" (standalone) and "testautoRIFT_ISCE.py" (with ISCE) command._

**For modular use:**

* In Python environment, type the following to import the "autoRIFT" module and initialize the "autoRIFT" object

_With ISCE:_

       import isce
       from contrib.geo_autoRIFT.autoRIFT import autoRIFT_ISCE
       obj = autoRIFT_ISCE()
       obj.configure()

_Standalone:_

       from autoRIFT import autoRIFT
       obj = autoRIFT()

* The "autoRIFT" object has several inputs that have to be assigned (listed below; can also be obtained by referring to "testautoRIFT.py"): 
       
       ------------------input------------------
       I1                                                 reference image (extracted image patches defined as "source")
       I2                                                 test image (extracted image patches defined as "template"; displacement = motion vector of I2 relative to I1)
       xGrid [units = integer image pixels]               horizontal pixel index at each grid point
       yGrid [units = integer image pixels]               vertical pixel index at each grid point
       (if xGrid and yGrid not provided, a regular grid spanning the entire image will be automatically set up, which is similar to the conventional ISCE module, "ampcor" or "denseampcor")
       Dx0 [units = integer image pixels]                 horizontal "downstream" reach location (that specifies the horizontal pixel displacement of the template's search center relative to the source's) at each grid point
       Dy0 [units = integer image pixels]                 vertical "downstream" reach location (that specifies the vertical pixel displacement of the template's search center relative to the source's) at each grid point
       (if Dx0 and Dy0 not provided, an array with zero values will be automatically assigned and there will be no offsets of the search centers)

* After the inputs are specified, run the module as below
       
       obj.preprocess_filt_XXX() or obj.preprocess_db()
       obj.uniform_data_type()
       obj.runAutorift()

where "XXX" can be "wal" for the Wallis filter, "hps" for the trivial high-pass filter, "sob" for the Sobel filter, "lap" for the Laplacian filter, and also a logarithmic operator without filtering is adopted for occasions where low-frequency components (i.e. topography) are desired, i.e. "obj.preprocess_db()".

* The "autoRIFT" object has the following four outputs: 
       
       ------------------output------------------
       Dx [units = decimal image pixels]                  estimated horizontal pixel displacement
       Dy [units = decimal image pixels]                  estimated vertical pixel displacement
